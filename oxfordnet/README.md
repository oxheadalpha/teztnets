Oxfordnet starts on Nairobi protocol then upgrades to Oxford at the end of cycle 2.

We welcome bootstrap bakers for Oxfordnet! The process is opt-in: please make yourself known in the baking slack, or make a Pull Request against the teztnets repo [Nairobinet definition](https://github.com/oxheadalpha/teztnets/blob/main/oxfordnet/values.yaml) file.

Oxfordnet has 8 second blocks (twice faster than mainnet).

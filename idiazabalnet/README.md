🔥 If you're here, this means you belong to one of the few lucky people to take part into the testnet using the brand new consensus algorithm [Tenderbake](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html). Congratulations and thanks in advance! This page shows you how to set up your system and actively participate in testing Tenderbake.

⚠️  We are maintaining a [`testnet/idiazabalnet`](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/tezos/-/tree/testnet/idiazabalnet) branch with a snapshot of protocol alpha from 2021-11-22. If any upgrades are needed, they will go to this branch. **Do not use most recent master branch**.

⚠️  There are no released packages or binaries for this testnet. You must build from source or use Docker.

⚠️  Tenderbake has no endorser. The endorser binary does not exist. This is normal. Running the baker daemon is enough.

⚠️  You can not sign with Ledger for now. You need to use a hot wallet address.

⚠️  Idiazabalnet does not upgrade and stays on the same protocol from genesis.

⚠️  initially, 67% of the stake will belong to Nomadic Labs bakers, in order to facilitate debugging.

⚠️ Our regular faucets created for each testnet does not work Idiazabalnet. The Baking Bad team's Telegram bot faucet should be used instead: https://t.me/tezos_faucet_bot
